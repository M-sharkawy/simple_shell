#																																 ** **Simple Shell Team Project** **
#																																		** **By Martain and Mostafa** **

##  **üìù Project Overview**
The project is developed in C and follows the Shell Betty linter guidelines to ensure code consistency and quality.

##  **‚úÖ General Requirements**
- **Compilation:** All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the following flags:
## `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **File Format:** Each file must end with a newline.
- **Documentation:** A `README.md` file must be present at the root of the project directory.
- **Code Style:** Code must be formatted according to the Betty style, verified with betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- **Memory Management:** The shell should be free of memory leaks.
- **Function Limit:** Each file should contain no more than five functions.
- **Header Files:** All header files should use include guards.

##  **üìÑ Project Description**
The **hsh** project involves creating a simple UNIX command language interpreter that can read and execute commands from a file or standard input.

##  **‚öôÔ∏è How hsh Works**
- **Prompt and Input:** hsh displays a prompt and waits for user input.
- **Process Handling:** It spawns a child process to manage the command execution.
- **Command Execution:** The interpreter checks for built-in commands, aliases in the PATH, and local executable programs. The command, along with its arguments, replaces the child process.
- **Returning to Prompt:** After the command execution, the program returns to the parent process and displays the prompt again, ready for a new command.
- **Exit Options:** To exit, press `Ctrl-D` or type `exit` (with or without a status).
- **on-Interactive Mode:** The shell also supports non-interactive execution.
